113 is a <a href="https://hamdanbasri.github.io/113/">website</a> I created for documentation and sharing information that I find might be helpful to other developers out there. These documentation includes Unity, Unreal Engine and Spark AR. There is also a playable <a href="https://hamdanbasri.github.io/113/atom.html">demo</a> that you could try out.
